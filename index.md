This is the website for the Open-Instance Power System Library (OpenIPSL) documentation. 

## **OpenIPSL Description**

The [OpenIPSL](https://github.com/OpenIPSL/OpenIPSL) is a library of power system component models written in the [Modelica](http://modelica.org) language that can be used for power system dynamic analysis, such as phasor time-domain simulations. The OpenIPSL is currently developed and maintained by Prof. [Luigi Vanfretti's](https://github.com/lvanfretti) research group [ALSETLab](https://github.com/ALSETLab) at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://rpi.edu), Troy, NY, collaborators and friends, such as [Dietmar Winkler](https://github.com/dietmarw) and [FOSSEE](https://om.fossee.in/fellowship2018) (contributions are welcome!).
